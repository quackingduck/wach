usage = """
The "server" version of `wach`. Pass it a command to start a long running
process (such as a web server) and it will run that process then monitor
the current directory for file modifications. When a file changes it will
automatically restart the process.

Usage:
  wachs [options] <command>

Required:
  <command>
    The command to restart every time an update occurs in the directory being monitored.

Options:
  -o|--only <globs>
    Only run <command> when the path that changed matches <globs>.

  -e|--except <globs>
    Only run <command> when the path that changed doesn't match <globs>.

  Quote the <globs> ("*.c") or add a trailing comma (*.c,) to prevent your shell from
  automatically expanding  them.

Examples:
  wachs node server.js
  wachs coffee server.coffee
  wachs ruby sinatra-app.rb
  wachs -o server/*.js, node server.js
