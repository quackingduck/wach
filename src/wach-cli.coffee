usage = """
Run a command every when file changes occur in the current directory. If
the command you want to run is a long running process like a web server
see `wachs`

Usage:
  wach [options] <command>

Required:
  <command>
    Run every time an update occurs in the directory being monitored.
    If the command includes `{}` it will be subsituted for the path that changed.

Options:
  -o|--only <globs>
    Only run <command> when the path that changed matches <globs>.

  -e|--except <globs>
    Only run <command> when the path that changed doesn't match <globs>.

  Quote the <globs> ("*.c") or add a trailing comma (*.c,) to prevent your shell from
  automatically expanding  them.

Examples:
  wach make
  wach -o *.c, make
  wach -o *.coffee, coffee {}
  TEST_DIR=generators wach -o **/*.rb, bundle exec rake test
