"watch changes"

  Watch for changes to files within the current directory and run a command
  when they occur.

  Wach is really fast, the command is run as soon as the file changes, no
  polling delay.

  Comes with two executables: `wach` and `wachs`.

  The `wach` utility will run any command (or inline shell script) whenever
  files in the current directory are updated.

  The `wachs` (there's an "s" on the end) utility does the same thing but for
  commands that launch a long running process like a web server. It'll kill
  the current process and launch a new one.

Requirements

  Only runs on OS X 10.7 (Lion). Sorry

Install

  npm install wach

Examples

  # Run `make` every time a file in the current directory is updated/added
  wach make

  # Compile and run on every change
  wach "gcc hello.c && ./a.out"

  # Only watch for changes to coffee files, compile the one that changed
  wach -o *.coffee, coffee -c {}

  # Run the tests every time a ruby file changes
  TEST_DIR=generators wach -o **/*.rb, bundle exec rake test

  # Restart a node app any time a js file changes
  wachs -o *.js, node server.js

Node API

  wach = require('wach');
  wach('.', function(path) {
    return console.log("something happened to " + path + "!");
  })
